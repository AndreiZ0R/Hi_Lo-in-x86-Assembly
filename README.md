# Hi_Lo-in-x86-Assembly
<h3> Classic Higher-Lower guessing game in x86 Assembly </h3>
Requirements:
<p>
- download the extra files in the repo, they will contain everything you need for running the program<br>
- make sure to start nothepad++ with administrator rights, otherwise you won't be able to properly use Ollydbg
</p>
Click this  
<a href = "https://www.mediafire.com/file/1i8w8a7jqi76yyc/asm_tools.rar/file" target = "_blank">link</a>
to download the complete .zip to fully use the game.


<h2> How to use</h2>
<h3>In the asm_tools.zip file, you will find 3 folders</h3>
<p>
  - the first is masm_minimal, which is the same as the one in this repo<br>
  - npp, where you will find notepad++.exe (the *IDE* you'll use)<br>
  - and ollydbg, which is a debuger for .asm programs<br>
  - then, you can simply open the .asm file in notepad++ and hit Ctrl+F6 to run it, or through Plugins -> ASM Plugin -> Run Program
  </p>
 
 <p><br> Also, the plugin comes with a code template that may help you write further Assembly programs</p>
 
<h3>Remainder to open notepad++ as an administrator to properly use ollydbg and it's features :)</h3>
